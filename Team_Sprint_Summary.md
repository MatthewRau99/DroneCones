# Flapjack Heros Sprint Summary #

## Sprint 2: Design ##

### High-Level Design ###
For our week spent on the High-Level design, we had an initial meeting on September 19 to discuss what would be needed, and split up work amongst our group. We then had a follow-up meeting on the 22nd to present our work, and discuss any changes or further work that was necessary.

For the High-Level Design, each of the team members worked on the following:
*   Jordan worked on the Security design, and the user interface design.
*   Treyson also worked primarily on the user interface design.
*   Emily wrote our expectations for the hardware platform of our application, and working the internal interfaces.
*   Nathan also worked on the internal interfaces.
*   Samuel and Matt worked on the external interfaces together.

### Low-Level Design ###
For this week, we had one online meeting on September 26 where we discussed how to break up the work. We then had a follow-up in person meeting on September 29 where each group presented their work so far for feedback from the rest of the group, before working together for a while on defining the low level design.

For the Low-Level Design, each of the team members worked on the following:
*   Samuel and Jordan made a text-based ui flow of the entire web app, and created a basic ui/ux prototype for some use cases using Figma.
*   Emily, Treyson and Nathan worked together to define the back-end design, including defining the various classes and class relationships used by our web app. They also created uml diagrams to represent these classes.
*   Matt worked to define our apps database structure, defining what tables and columns are needed, as well as defining a list of functions that will interact with the database to preserve abstraction.



## Sprint 1: Requirements ##
We started with an introductory meeting September 12 in which we started to talk about requirements, and split work on the requirements document

*   Treyson worked on the use cases diagram and set up the GitLab
*   Samuel worked on the user requirements
*   Emily worked on the business requirements
*   Matt worked on the github, helped on the use cases diagram and GitLab formatting
*   Nathan worked on the customer requirements
*   Jordan worked on functional requirements and led the team.
We believe we have a strong grasp on the requirements as we go into the design phase of this project.
