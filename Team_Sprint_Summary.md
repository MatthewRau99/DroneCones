#### Team Meeting #1 ####
We started with an introductory meeting September 12 in which we started to talk about requirements, and split work on the requirements document

- Treyson worked on the use cases diagram and set up the GitLab
- Samuel worked on the user requirements
- Emily worked on the business requirements
- Matt worked on the github, helped on the use cases diagram and GitLab formatting
- Nathan worked on the customer requirements
- Jordan worked on functional requirements and led the team.
We believe we have a strong grasp on the requirments as we go into the design phase of this project.
